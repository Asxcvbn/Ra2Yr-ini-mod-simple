# Ra2Yr-ini-mod-simple
a simple and naive yr mod.

TODO:

    add VHPScan to all non-instant projectile tanks; done
    should i include FV? 
    and maybe infantry like GGI.
    if so: 
        all missile-likes (GGI,FV) 
            VHPScan=Strong
        all cannon-like (tanks)
            VHPSCan=Normal
